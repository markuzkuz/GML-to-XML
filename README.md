# GML-to-XML
I made a very simple script to parse any values from an URL to include it inside an XML file using etree.lxml and then I parametrize all the script using ArgParse.
To run the script you need to specify a --input_file, --output_file and a --input_url in this case or any other source where you have data that wanted to add in the XML document.
